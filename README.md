# Hermes Agent Railway Template

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/hermes-railway-template?referralCode=uTN7AS&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

Deploy [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) to Railway as a worker service with persistent state.

This template is worker-only: setup and configuration are done through Railway Variables, then the container bootstraps Hermes automatically on first run.

## What you get

- Hermes gateway running as a Railway worker
- First-boot bootstrap from environment variables
- Persistent Hermes state on a Railway volume at `/data`
- Telegram, Discord, or Slack support (at least one required)

## How it works

1. You configure required variables in Railway.
2. On first boot, entrypoint initializes Hermes under `/data/.hermes`.
3. On future boots, the same persisted state is reused.
4. Container starts `hermes gateway`.

## Railway deploy instructions

In Railway Template Composer:

1. Add a volume mounted at `/data`.
2. Deploy as a worker service.
3. Configure variables listed below.

Template defaults (already included in `railway.toml`):

- `HERMES_HOME=/data/.hermes`
- `HOME=/data`
- `MESSAGING_CWD=/data/workspace`

## Default environment variables

This template defaults to Telegram + OpenRouter. These are the default variables to fill when deploying:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=""
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=""
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=""
```

You can add or change variables later in Railway service Variables.
For the latest supported variables and behavior, follow upstream Hermes documentation:

- https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent
- https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/README.md

## Required runtime variables

You must set:

- At least one inference provider config:
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or
  - `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- At least one messaging platform:
  - Telegram: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
  - Discord: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
  - Slack: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`

Strongly recommended allowlists:

- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`
- `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS`
- `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS`

Allowlist format examples (comma-separated, no brackets, no quotes):

- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321`
- `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789012345678,234567890123456789`
- `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U01234ABCDE,U09876WXYZ`

Use plain comma-separated values like `123,456,789`.
Do not use JSON or quoted arrays like `[123,456]` or `"123","456"`.

Optional global controls:

- `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` (not recommended)

Provider selection tip:

- If you set multiple provider keys, set `HERMES_INFERENCE_PROVIDER` (for example: `openrouter`) to avoid auto-selection surprises.

## Environment variable reference

For the full and up-to-date list, check out the [Hermes repository](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

## Simple usage guide

After deploy:

1. Start a chat with your bot on Telegram/Discord/Slack.
2. If using allowlists, ensure your user ID is included.
3. Send a normal message (for example: `hello`).
4. Hermes should respond via the configured model provider.

Helpful first checks:

- Confirm gateway logs show platform connection success.
- Confirm volume mount exists at `/data`.
- Confirm your provider variables are set and valid.

## Running Hermes commands manually

If you want to run `hermes ...` commands manually inside the deployed service (for example `hermes config`, `hermes model`, or `hermes pairing list`), use [Railway SSH](https://docs.railway.com/cli/ssh) to connect to the running container.

Example commands after connecting:

```bash
hermes status
hermes config
hermes model
hermes pairing list
```

## Runtime behavior

Entrypoint (`scripts/entrypoint.sh`) does the following:

- Validates required provider and platform variables
- Writes runtime env to `${HERMES_HOME}/.env`
- Creates `${HERMES_HOME}/config.yaml` if missing
- Persists one-time marker `${HERMES_HOME}/.initialized`
- Starts `hermes gateway`

## Troubleshooting

- `401 Missing Authentication header`: provider/key mismatch (often wrong provider auto-selection or missing API key for selected provider).
- Bot connected but no replies: check allowlist variables and user IDs.
- Data lost after redeploy: verify Railway volume is mounted at `/data`.

## Build pinning

Docker build arg:

- `HERMES_GIT_REF` (default: a pinned Hermes commit SHA, see Dockerfile)

The default is a specific SHA the vendor patches have been tested
against. Override at build time to track a different upstream ref:
`docker build --build-arg HERMES_GIT_REF=main ...`. Bumping the
default SHA means re-running `scripts/test-patches.sh` to verify every
patch's anchor still exists in the new tree.

## Vendor patches

The Dockerfile applies a small set of vendor patches to the Hermes
source tree during the builder stage (see `patches/`). Each patch is
idempotent and marker-guarded, so rebuilding is safe. Current patches:

- **slack-strict-mention** — adds a `slack.strict_mention: true` config
  key (Hermes PR [#12258](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/12258),
  still open upstream at time of writing). When enabled, channel
  threads require an explicit `@mention` on every message to trigger
  the bot, instead of auto-replying to any message under a thread
  the bot has touched.
- **send-message-edit-action** — exposes `action="edit"` on the
  built-in `send_message` tool so the agent can update a previously-
  sent message instead of having to post a fresh one. Routes to
  Slack's `chat.update` via the same token/proxy path the tool uses
  for `send`. Telegram / Discord / Matrix / etc. return a clear
  "not yet implemented" error rather than silently falling back to a
  new send. No upstream PR yet — the plan is to port this back to
  `NousResearch/hermes-agent` next and drop the patch once it merges.

Remove a patch from `patches/apply-hermes-patches.py` once it lands
in an upstream Hermes release this template's `HERMES_GIT_REF`
resolves to. Verify the patches still apply cleanly with
`scripts/test-patches.sh` (no Docker required — clones Hermes at the
pinned SHA, runs the script, checks idempotency + markers).

## Local smoke test

```bash
docker build -t hermes-railway-template .

docker run --rm \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxx \
  -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC \
  -e TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789 \
  -v "$(pwd)/.tmpdata:/data" \
  hermes-railway-template
```
